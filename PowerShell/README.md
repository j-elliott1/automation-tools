# PowerShell Scripts

This folder contains custom PowerShell scripts I’ve written to support identity and access management (IAM), system administration, and automation efforts.

### 🛠️ Scripts Include:
- **disableInactiveUsers.ps1**  
  Disables users in Active Directory who haven’t logged in within a defined period.

- **exportGroupMembership.ps1**  
  Pulls a report of group membership for auditing and compliance reviews.

These are written with clarity in mind, including comments and parameter support where possible. Adapt freely for your environment.
