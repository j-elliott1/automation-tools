# Splunk Queries

This folder contains a collection of Splunk queries (SPL) that I’ve developed for security monitoring, identity tracking, and compliance auditing.

### 🔍 Queries Include:
- **failedLogins.spl**  
  Identify repeated failed login attempts and possible brute-force indicators.

- **groupChanges.spl**  
  Track group membership changes in Active Directory environments.

- **userLogonActivity.spl**  
  Monitor logon activity by user, system, or time period.

Each query was used in real-world operational settings—tailored to improve visibility into access, risk, and behavior across systems.
