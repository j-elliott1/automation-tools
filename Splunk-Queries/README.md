A collection of Splunk queries Iâ€™ve written and refined over the years, focused on:
- IAM activity (logon failures, group membership changes)
- Audit trails and compliance reporting
- Security and threat detection patterns

These queries can be dropped into the Splunk search bar as-is or customized for your environment.
