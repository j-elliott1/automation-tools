# Automation Tools Hub

Welcome to my automation tools library—a curated collection of PowerShell scripts and Splunk queries I’ve created to support system administration, IAM governance, and security operations.

These tools reflect hands-on, real-world work from various enterprise environments. Whether you're looking to automate Active Directory tasks or dig into audit trails with Splunk, this repo has something for you.

## 📂 Contents

- [`PowerShell/`](./PowerShell)  
  Scripts for automating IAM tasks, Active Directory cleanup, user reporting, and more.

- [`Splunk-Queries/`](./Splunk-Queries)  
  Saved Splunk queries for tracking failed logins, group changes, and user activity.

## 💡 Why This Exists

I’ve worked across enterprise environments managing identity, security, and compliance operations. These tools reflect my hands-on experience with PowerShell, Splunk, and automation workflows. (more on automation to come)
